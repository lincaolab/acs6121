# The WSL-ROS Simulation Environment

To support these courses we've created a custom ROS (Noetic) and Ubuntu (20.04) environment which runs on Windows 10 using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). We call this **"WSL-ROS"**, and you can find out more about it - and how to use it - here:
