# About

This is the home of some practical lab courses developed by Dr Tom Howard, a University Teacher at the University of Sheffield. The material here is designed for teaching **ROS (the Robot Operating System)**, mobile robots, and autonoumous navigation. It has been developed to support a range of **practical teaching activities** that take place in [The Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond) for a range of different degree courses, including ACS6121.

This lab uses a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Typically, we start in simulation first on [a WSL-based simulation platform that we use for this](https://lincaolab.github.io/acs6121/wsl-ros/). Everything you'll learn in simulation is directly applicable to real robots too; so you'll be able to apply your new-learnt ROS knowledge to the real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots that we have in The Diamond.
